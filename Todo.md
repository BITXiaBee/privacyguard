## ToDo List

1. Import contact from phone for leak detection
- Turn on/off VPN (right now only toggle filtering)
- DB: delete old leaks (maybe configurable?)
- DB: need to make DBhandler thread safe (since multiple filter threads)
- Test Async running
- Test ignoring per app and per category
- Beta release
	- description
	- signed APK
- setting/about page for async
- Improve logging practice
- Social Media integration (be able to share leakage statistics)
- OnResume/OnStop as well as testing app life cycle/corner cases (force stop, etc.)
- Stress testing (ensure VPN does not cause performance issues
- User studies to gain feedback/Tweaks to front facing UI (increased height for table rows, icons, etc.)
- Rating system which associates each app with a five star rating based on leakage history/ show star rating below app icons on phone
- Allow an option for the user to share statistics with us so overall stats on apps can be aggregated
- Potentially display leakage stats as they become more complex in graphical form
- Test on multiple OS versions, and look into new features offered by 5.x and 6.x
