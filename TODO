1: App name might not be sufficient for id, change to use package name instead
    a: but we can only get UID from port, and UID could be shared by multiple packages....(for example those google native apps)
2: No good regex for contact detection
     match against Contact App/Phone book?
3: DB monthly reset method need to be fixed
4: using global filter variable to toggle app "on/off" rather than start/stop vpn. Good approach?
